Line transects are indicated by lines on the map. Click on a specific location on the map to get a list of programmes for that location, or click on a specific point/ polygon to see the pogramme associated with that location. The panel on the left (B) shows the total number of programmes currently in the portal as well as the total number of programmes for specific EOVs. The results in the map can be filtered to show specific (C) EOVs, (D) EOV sub-variables and EBVs by selecting for them in the panel. Filtering can also be done according to the desired Readiness levels (E) of a programme. Specific programmes can also be filtered/ searched for by filtering for them by name (F) or by selecting from the list.</p> <p> </p> <p>When selecting an individual programme, or searching for a programme by name, a new panel will open containing all the available metadata for that programme (G), as entered and maintained by the metadata provider for that programme.

The layer data can be downloaded in various formats under Pick your download format, either as the complete original dataset or only spatial files.
